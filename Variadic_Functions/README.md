## Understanding Variadic Functions in C

This tutorial provides a comprehensive understanding of variadic functions in C. Before diving into them, let's revisit fundamental concepts like variables and functions.

### Variables in C
A variable is a named storage location used to hold data.

**Syntax:**
```c
data_type variable_name = value;
```

**Example:**
```c
int score = 90; // Integer variable 'score' with value 90
char grade = 'A'; // Character variable 'grade' with value 'A'
```

### Functions in C
A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

**Syntax:**
```c
return_type function_name(datatype parameter, datatype parameter) {
  statement block
}
```

**Example:**
```c
int sum(int i, int j) {
  return (i + j);
}
```
